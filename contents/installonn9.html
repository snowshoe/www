<h2>Compiling from sources</h2>

<p>If you already have a scratchbox with a Harmattan setup on your machine is very easy to compile and run snowshoe on your n9, first select the ARMEL target on scratchbox, install the repository package (step 2), all dependencies (webkit-snapshot package) then go to snowshoe directory outsite scratchbox and type:</p>

<pre>$ ./tools/build-deploy.sh -i &lt;device ip> -r</pre>
